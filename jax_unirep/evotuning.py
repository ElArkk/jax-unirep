) -> Dict:
    """
    Return mLSTM weights fitted to predict the next letter in each AA sequence.

    The training loop is as follows, depending on the batching strategy:

    Length batching:

    - At each iteration,
    of all sequence lengths present in `sequences`,
    one length gets chosen at random.
    - Next, `batch_size` number of sequences of the chosen length
    get selected at random.
    - If there are less sequences of a given length than `batch_size`,
    all sequences of that length get chosen.
    - Those sequences then get passed through the model.
    No padding of sequences occurs.

    To get batching of sequences by length done,
    we call on `batch_sequences` from our `utils.py` module,
    which returns a list of sub-lists,
    in which each sub-list contains the indices
    in the original list of sequences
    that are of a particular length.

    Random batching:

    - Before training, all sequences get padded
    to be the same length as the longest sequence
    in `sequences`.
    - Then, at each iteration,
    we randomly sample `batch_size` sequences
    and pass them through the model.

    The training loop does not adhere
    to the common notion of `epochs`,
    where all sequences would be seen by the model
    exactly once per epoch.
    Instead sequences always get sampled at random,
    and one epoch approximately consists of
    `round(len(sequences) / batch_size)` weight updates.
    Asymptotically, this should be approximately equiavlent
    to doing epoch passes over the dataset.

    To learn more about the passing of `params`,
    have a look at the `evotune` function docstring.

    You can optionally dump parameters
    and print weights every `epochs_per_print` epochs
    to monitor training progress.
    For ergonomics, training/holdout set losses are estimated
    on a batch size the same as `batch_size`,
    rather than calculated exactly on the entire set.
    Set `epochs_per_print` to `None` to avoid parameter dumping.

    ### Parameters

    - `params`: mLSTM1900 and Dense parameters.
    - `sequences`: List of sequences to evotune on.
    - `n`: The number of iterations to evotune on.
    - `batch_method`: One of "length" or "random".
    - `batch_size`: If random batching is used,
        number of sequences per batch.
        As a rule of thumb, batch size of 50 consumes
        about 5GB of GPU RAM.
    - `step_size`: The learning rate.
    - `holdout_seqs`: Holdout set, an optional input.
    - `proj_name`: The directory path for weights to be output to.
    - `epochs_per_print`: Number of epochs to progress before printing
        and dumping of weights.
        Must be greater than or equal to 1.
    - `backend`: Whether or not to use the GPU. Defaults to "cpu",
        but can be set to "gpu" if desired.

    Evolutionarily tune the model to a set of sequences.

    Evotuning is described in the original UniRep and eUniRep papers.
    This reimplementation of evotune provides a nicer API
    that automatically handles multiple sequences of variable lengths.

    Evotuning always needs a starter set of weights.
    By default, the pre-trained weights from the Nature Methods paper are used.
    However, other pre-trained weights are legitimate.

    We first use optuna to figure out how many epochs to fit
    before overfitting happens.
    To save on computation time, the number of trials run
    defaults to 20, but can be configured.

    By default, mLSTM1900 and Dense weights from the paper are used
    by passing in `params=None`,
    but if you want to use randomly intialized weights:

        from jax_unirep.evotuning import init_fun
        from jax.random import PRNGKey

        _, params = init_fun(PRNGKey(0), input_shape=(-1, 10))

    or dumped weights:

        from jax_unirep.utils import load_params

        params = load_params(folderpath="path/to/params/folder")

    This function is intended as an automagic way of identifying
    the best model and training routine hyperparameters.
    If you want more control over how fitting happens,
    please use the `fit()` function directly.
    There is an example in the `examples/` directory
    that shows how to use it.

    ### Parameters

    - `sequences`: Sequences to evotune against.
    - `params`: Parameters to be passed into `mLSTM1900` and `Dense`.
        Optional; if None, will default to weights from paper,
        or you can pass in your own set of parameters,
        as long as they are stax-compatible.
    - `proj_name`: Name of the project,
        used to name created output directory.
    - `out_dom_seqs`: Out-domain holdout set of sequences,
        to check for loss on to prevent overfitting.
    - `n_trials: The number of trials Optuna should attempt.
    - `n_epochs_config`: A dictionary of kwargs

        This controls how many epochs to have Optuna test.
        See source code for default configuration,
        at the definition of `n_epochs_kwargs`.
    - `learning_rate_config`: A dictionary of kwargs
        to `trial.suggest_loguniform`,
        which are: `name`, `low`, `high`.
        This controls the learning rate of the model.
        See source code for default configuration,

    - `n_splits`: The number of folds of cross-validation to do.

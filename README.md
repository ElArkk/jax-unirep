# jax-unirep

A performant reimplementation of the UniRep protein featurization model in JAX.

The UniRep model was developed in George Church's lab,
see the original publication
[here][arxiv] (bioRxiv) or [here][nature] (Nature Methods),
as well as the [repository][repo] containing the original model.

This repo is a self-contained version of the UniRep model
(so far only the 1900 hidden-unit mLSTM),
with additional utility APIs that support protein engineering workflows.

## Installation

Ensure that your compute environment allows you to run JAX code.
(A modern Linux or macOS with a GLIBC>=2.23 is probably necessary.)

Then, you can install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install jax-unirep
```

If you want the latest and greatest, you can install directly from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ElArkk/jax-unirep.git
```

## More Details

Documentation on how to use `jax-unirep` is available [here][docs].

We highly encourage community contributions to this project!
For more information, see the section in the docs on our [contributing][cont] guidelines.

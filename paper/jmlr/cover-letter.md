Dear Editors,

We submit our manuscript titled,
"jax-unirep: Accelerated and User-Friendly Protein Machine Learning with JAX"
for consideration under the Machine Learning Open Source Software section
of JMLR.

In particular, we are submitting `jax-unirep` version 1.0.1.
Our reimplementation is licensed under the terms of GPL-3.0;
the weights provided by the original authors
are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 license.

Since announcing the pre-1.x version of the model earlier this year,
we have accepted contributions from contributors who are not part of Novartis
(which employs the two main developers of `jax-unirep`).
Additionally, it has been starred by 35 users, 7 forks exist,
and 7 unique users from academic institutes and companies
(we either asked them, or it was shown on their GitHub profiles)
in many geographic locations
have helped us by raising bug finds on the issue tracker.
For a new package that supports machine learning in the life sciences,
we consider this to be evidence of growing impact.

For reviews, we would like to suggest the following individuals,
who would be qualified to review the package from two different perspectives:

1. Matthew Johnson (mattjj@google.com): He is one of the lead developers of JAX.
2. Simone Fulle (snfu@novonordisk.com): She is a fellow protein engineer and modeller.

We believe a subject domain-specific machine learning package
would be a valuable addition to the MLOSS section of JMLR,
as real-world impact is generated at the front-lines of domain application.
Consideration for review would also be in-line with the broader JMLR mission
of honoring the effort of turning a method
into a highly usable piece of software.
We thank you for your consideration,
and look forward to hearing back favourably.

Sincerely,

Eric J. Ma

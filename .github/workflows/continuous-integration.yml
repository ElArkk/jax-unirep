  # In principle, these don't rely on the environment.yml,
  # and can be run in a bare native Python env instead.
  # Doing so gives us speed, so we can quickly uncover code style issues
  # instead of having to wait for the environment to be built first.

  # TODO: Build docs.
  # hints for @ElArkk:
  # - each job is indexed by a YAML key (e.g. "run-slow-tests").
  #   you'll probably want a new job for docs building.
  # - don't forget to make the new job dependent on "build-environment" like the others,
  #   this will ensure it runs only _after_ "build-environment" has finished.
  # - you'll need at least the following steps as a baseline inside the new job:
  #    - "checkout"
  #    - "download environment tarball"
  #    - "unpack environment and activate it"
  #   as the filesystem state is not preserved between jobs.
  # - Then build the docs by inserting a new step.
  #
  # This workflow only executes on pull requests.
  # You probably _don't_ want to include a github action step
  # that deploys to GitHub Pages here,
  # as the intent should be to make sure that the docs successfully build
  # but don't get deployed.
  # You can create another workflow that builds the environment
  # and then deploys the docs in a separate YAML file.
